# Pythonista-Ticket-System
First learning project from a group of enthusiastic Python learners. The goal of the project is to create a ticketing system. Users on the platform can create tickets for issues or task items, and the tickets can interface with other software (email, calender)

## User Interface

The user interface will begin as a CLI running on a shell. The interface will allow users to:
- Make new tickets
- Edit existing tickets
- Delete existing tickets
- Send a ticket to another platform (email, calendar)

In addition, tickets will have fields for categorization, as well as a list of users that can be attached to the ticket.

## Database

The database will be used to store user accounts and passwords. There needs to be a secure method of entering and modifying data on the database (I found this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd-0G0MigUA&t=1104s) to be a helpful introduction). The database will also be storing tickets as well as the tags and users that can be associated with a particular ticket. 

## Interface to APIs

Tickets should be able to link to calendar and email software, so interfacing with the respecive APIs will be necessary.
